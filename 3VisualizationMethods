Visualization and Documentation
   8. Use Case Flow Diagrams should answer the question, What is the visual representation of the use case flows?
      There are several effective approaches:
      1. **Swimlane Diagrams**: Show actors in lanes with steps flowing horizontally, including system components (this)
      2. **Sequence Diagrams**: Show step-by-step interactions between actors and system components over time(this)
      3. **Activity Diagrams**: Show the flow of activities with decision points and parallel processes (this)
      
   9. Architecture Component Mapping should answer the question, What technical components support each use case step?
      Visual approaches include:
      1. **Layered Architecture Diagrams**: Show how use cases map to presentation, business, data, and infrastructure layers
      2. **Component Interaction Diagrams**: Show which architecture components interact during each use case step (this)
      3. **Deployment Diagrams**: Show how use cases execute across different servers, databases, and services
      
   10. Integrated Use Case-Architecture Diagrams should answer the question, How do use case flows relate to system architecture?
       Recommended approaches:
       1. **Annotated Flow Diagrams**: Use case flow with architecture components annotated at each step (this)
       2. **Multi-Layer Diagrams**: Use case flow on top layer, architecture components on bottom layer, with connections (this)
       3. **Component Responsibility Diagrams**: Show which components are responsible for each use case step
       
   11. Documentation Integration should answer the question, How do diagrams connect to detailed documentation?
       Best practices:
       1. **Hyperlinked Diagrams**: Each step/component links to detailed documentation
       2. **Trace Matrix**: Table showing relationships between requirements, use case steps, and architecture components
       3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document why specific components were chosen for specific use case steps

### Implementation Mapping

This shows how each use case step maps to specific architecture components and non-functional requirements:

**Step 1 (Receive Input)**
- Components: Load Balancer → API Gateway → Input Validator
- NFRs: Performance (<200ms), Scalability (1000 req/sec), Security (authentication)
- Implementation: Nginx load balancer, Kong API gateway, Express.js validator

**Step 2 (Format Validation)**  
- Components: Regex Engine → Validation Cache → Pattern Matcher
- NFRs: Performance (<50ms), Reliability (99.9%), Accuracy (RFC 3986 compliance)
- Implementation: Built-in regex, Redis cache, custom validation library

**Step 3 (Accessibility Check)**
- Components: HTTP Client → Connection Pool → Circuit Breaker
- NFRs: Performance (5s timeout), Scalability (concurrent requests), Reliability (retry logic)
- Implementation: Axios HTTP client, connection pooling, Hystrix circuit breaker

**Step 4 (Security Screening)**
- Components: Security Service → Blacklist DB → External Scanner
- NFRs: Security (100% screening), Compliance (threat detection), Accuracy (no false negatives)
- Implementation: Custom security service, PostgreSQL blacklist, VirusTotal API
